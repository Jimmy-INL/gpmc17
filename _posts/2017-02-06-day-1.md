  end: "13:00"
  speaker: "Neil Lawrence"
  url: "http://inverseprobability.com"
  institute: "Amazon Research Cambridge and University of Sheffield"
  abstract: "This talk will develop the idea of the covariance function and give intutions as to how the marginal likelihood can be maximized. Given time we willl also develop the idea of multiple output Gaussian process models."
